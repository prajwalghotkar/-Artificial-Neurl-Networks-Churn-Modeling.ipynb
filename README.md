* Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, organized in layers, which work together to process data and solve complex problems.

* Customer churn modeling involves predicting which customers are likely to leave a service or business. This is crucial for businesses to retain customers and improve satisfaction. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs) can enhance prediction accuracy due to their ability to model complex relationships in data.

# Layers
* Input Layer: This layer receives input data from the external environment. Each neuron in this layer represents a feature of the input data.
* Hidden Layers: These layers perform computations and transformations on the input data. ANNs can have multiple hidden layers, allowing them to learn complex patterns.
* Output Layer: The final layer produces the output of the network, which can be a classification label or a continuous value, depending on the task.

# Neurons
* Each neuron processes inputs by calculating a weighted sum and applying an activation function. The weights determine the influence of each input on the neuron's output, 
  while the activation function introduces non-linearity into the model.

# Weights and Biases
* Weights are adjustable parameters that are optimized during training to minimize prediction errors. Biases allow neurons to activate even when all inputs are zero.

# Training Process
  Neural networks are typically trained using a method called backpropagation, which involves:
* Forward Propagation: Inputs are passed through the network to generate outputs.
* Loss Calculation: The difference between predicted outputs and actual targets is computed using a loss function.
* Backward Propagation: Gradients of the loss with respect to weights are calculated, and weights are updated to minimize loss using optimization algorithms like Stochastic 
  Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam

# Dataset
Utilize datasets such as the Telco Customer Churn Dataset or bank customer data, which typically include features like customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns.

# Data Preprocessing
* Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
* Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical formats (e.g., one-hot encoding).
* Normalization: Scale numerical features to improve model performance.

# Model Architecture
Design an ANN with:
* Input layer: Corresponding to the number of features.
* Hidden layers: One or more layers with activation functions like ReLU.
* Output layer: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (churn/no churn).

# Training the Model
* Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).
* Compile the model using an optimizer like Adam and a loss function such as binary crossentropy.
* Fit the model on the training data while monitoring validation loss.

# Evaluation
* Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
* Visualize results using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

# Visualization
* Include plots to show feature importance and model performance over epochs.
* Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualizations.
